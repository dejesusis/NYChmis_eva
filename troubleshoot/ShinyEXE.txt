The shiny.exe package provides a method to launch a Shiny application with a single click, without the need to open R or RStudio. It achieves this by creating a script and a shortcut that executes the script.
Steps to use shiny.exe to package your R Shiny app into an executable:

Install shiny.exe: If you haven't already, install the shiny.exe package from CRAN within your R environment:
Code

    install.packages("shiny.exe")

Navigate to your Shiny app directory: Open an R session and set your working directory to the root directory of your Shiny application (the folder containing your app.R or ui.R/server.R files).
Code

    setwd("path/to/your/shiny/app")

Run shiny.exe(): Execute the shiny.exe() function. This function will generate the necessary script and shortcut in your app's directory.
Code

    shiny.exe::shiny.exe()

Optional arguments:
app_name: You can specify a custom name for your app.

host = "public": If you want to launch the application on a public server and make it accessible to other devices on the same network, set this argument. The application will then be accessible via your IPv4 address and the assigned port.
Launch your app: After running shiny.exe(), a shortcut (e.g., Launch_App.lnk on Windows) will be created in your app's directory. Double-clicking this shortcut will launch your Shiny application in your default web browser.
Stop the application: The application will run in a terminal window opened by the shortcut. To stop the application, simply close this terminal window.
Note: While shiny.exe provides a convenient way to launch your app without RStudio, it does not create a fully standalone executable that bundles R itself. Users will still need an R installation on their system for the app to run. For creating truly standalone executables that include a portable R environment, consider packages like RInno or exploring solutions involving Electron with R integration.
